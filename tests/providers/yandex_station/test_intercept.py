"""Tests for the experimental Alice-playback intercept feature.

When Alice (Yandex voice assistant) starts music on a Station, the intercept
feature stops the Station's native player, resolves the track via the
``yandex_music`` MA music provider, and starts playback on a configured target
player.  Volume / seek / pause changes on the Station mirror to the target.

The feature is gated by two switches: a provider-level master toggle
(``intercept_feature_enabled``, default OFF) and a per-player toggle
(``intercept_enabled``).  Both must be ON for any intercept action to happen.
